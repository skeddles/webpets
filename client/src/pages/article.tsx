	<div className="page-body"><p id="6a1ae849-d01b-4f60-9846-5bcc7a0c8705" className="">Welcome to the very first class in the Lospec Pixel School Beginner Pixel Art Course! You might expect the first class to be a big info-dump about pixel art and various terms and definitions and techniques. But I don’t believe that’s the strongest foundation to build up your pixel art skills on. Instead we will begin with most fundamental pixel art concept/technique, which I call depiction.</p><p id="bcddf865-4af9-4bb4-84fd-d6e433ff0e47" className="">I hope that if you’re interested in pixel art, you’re already aware of what a pixel is, but just in case:</p><figure className="block-color-gray_background callout"  id="a3f0be30-e087-41ec-b489-7e371c0dee97"><div ><span className="icon">📖</span></div><div >Pixel - the smallest unit that makes of the information in a digital image, or the smallest unit that can be displayed on a digital screen. </div></figure><p id="75579a83-472d-478e-bc9c-cab54b6d1d22" className="">Everything you see on your computer is displayed using pixels, and almost all images on computers are stored as pixels. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re all pixel art — pixel art is intentionally created by placing limits on the pixels in these images:</p><figure className="block-color-gray_background callout"  id="aaf47406-7872-4d49-ac81-5e5392bb4aaf"><div ><span className="icon">📖</span></div><div >Pixel Art - A form of digital art where images are intentionally limited by low resolution and few colors</div></figure><p id="5e74785a-6647-4491-b85b-44b09b6e7d0c" className="">This is a rather narrow definition, and not all people would agree, but it’s good place for us to start.</p><p id="c9e7e74d-501f-453a-be59-e42bcc51f10c" className="">
	</p><p id="20bf9d8f-1ad1-40fe-b698-3c5c753e6030" className="">In this class you will jump right in, and start practicing the most basic and distilled skill in pixel art: arranging squares to make a recognizable image. That’s all pixel art really is. Yes there’s tons of techniques and tools for you to learn, but every single pixel artist from the noobiest noob to the most talented pixel-god is mainly just moving squares around until they stop looking like a collection of squares, and start looking like something more.</p><p id="80cc73e7-2940-433f-8acc-2124bccfd326" className="">
	</p><h2 id="82cd5d97-2219-4692-8ff1-e561b1d30cd4" className="">The Goal</h2><p id="c356dc04-b73e-42b8-8209-8c418269385d" className="">There’s a lot of different things to keep in mind while creating art. You’ll learn more things to consider the more classes you take, and the more you progress on your artistic journey. But there’s one fundamental goal in pixel art that should be considered before all others, and that’s what this lesson is about. </p><p id="34461285-da89-4db8-aa5f-cdc8527a753a" className="">Your goal is to create an image that can be understood by the people who view it. </p><p id="2a6e45f3-5351-4eeb-a56a-847d739506ed" className="">If you are creating a portrait of a dog, your #1 goal is to make sure that anyone who views it can easily identify the subject as a dog. Great texture or shading wont matter if your viewers are confused on what the subject is. It’s almost always a good idea to sacrifice detail and complexity for simplicity and clarity. </p><p id="39ecbe4c-a3c6-4345-9316-7c18d191a966" className="">This goes for all parts of your image too, not just the main subject. Small details can add a lot of depth and flavor to your image, they can even aid in making more important subjects easier to understand. But if a smaller subject isn’t easily easily understood, it does the opposite: it confuses and distracts the viewer from the important parts.</p><p id="8fe2d3c1-4cd3-43aa-ba87-fa14bbca34bb" className="">So your goal is not to continuously add detail, but to continuously refine your image until it’s as easy to understand as possible. This frequently means simplifying or removing details, even if they’re good ideas or realistic.</p><p id="d6c67f49-49d0-4842-9038-f4e9d6e7d481" className="">This concept is especially important in pixel art, since the restrictive nature of drawing with squares can make it hard to draw small details. In general, you have to tune your amount of detail to the canvas size, and if the canvas is too small to properly depict something, then you gotta leave it out.</p><p id="cb09cd5c-2b91-4351-a7cf-9990b7f0230e" className="">Pixel art is a simplification, similar to cartoons or graphic design, and it must be created with intentional purpose and clarity in mind.</p><h2 id="cc878383-91c0-426e-8dee-4f225e0ea31f" className="">The Process</h2><p id="b8ad211a-56d1-4b93-86b4-c469a1c1b4f6" className="">
	</p><p id="ae1f58de-047b-4386-b4a3-d27042649653" className="">Have you ever played one of those sliding puzzle games? You have a grid of squares with images on them, and you slide them around one at a time, trying to fit the pieces together in a way that makes sense. </p><p id="648d0dba-a2fa-4306-aed8-f80233691402" className="">
	</p><figure id="f56e9560-20a9-424a-a982-c1fb6ebf166c" className="image"><a href="wGl.gif"><img src="wGl.gif"/></a></figure><p id="a3c8619e-aac2-4143-b414-75968d0659dd" className="">
	</p><p id="d3e58756-0992-4d0d-a058-560c765aa274" className="">That’s almost exactly what you’re doing with pixel art: you’re repeatedly moving the squares around looking for the perfect way to arrange them so that they form a picture. Every pixel you add can greatly change what the end result is, but if you just keep pushing them, you’ll slowly get closer and closer to what it’s meant to be. You should try to view pixel art through this lens: a puzzle game where your goal is to keep rearranging the grid to get closer and closer to the image you want. </p><p id="3204598c-2b53-4b4c-9fdd-57c95d50708d" className="">
	</p><figure id="da4f63d2-d54c-4db9-8c1a-214f224381a5" className="image"><a href="ezgif-2-3faf6e8b5c.gif"><img src="ezgif-2-3faf6e8b5c.gif"/></a></figure><p id="3e8a000a-8d3d-4a62-a2da-1b18979e64c1" className="">You’ll notice very shortly (if you haven’t already) that creating something complex out of such simple shapes isn’t as easy as it seems. How do you create a circle using only squares? Well that’s what todays class will teach you: Depiction — which means to represent something through drawing. It’s a form of communication from artist to art-viewer, without any words. This is the challenge of pixel art — arranging your squares in a way that the viewer can understand what you’re drawing, without you needing to tell them. No other aspect of pixel art is more important than this.</p><p id="9967ce44-020c-4b97-b04f-d99885b31844" className="">
	</p><p id="8f14100b-8ecb-4eb1-8e96-a67e78585ed6" className="">It’s important that you understand that the process of pixel art is somewhat different than drawing - you aren’t trying to perform the perfect flick-of-the-wrist to get your lines perfect — perfection in pixel art comes from refinement. This means you start with a simple / flawed drawing, then you continuously make improvements to it. </p><p id="8ec827c7-78fb-42e8-ac1a-7cda386ed10e" className="">
	</p><p id="0bca0362-c340-45d3-b8be-7ea7252868c3" className="">A lot of the time, you’ll need to erase something you did before and try it again — that’s not just acceptable, it’s mandatory. It’s THE process. Never be afraid to erase or redo. You will never get it right on the first try, and the better you get at pixel art, the longer you’ll spend refining, redoing, tweaking, and experimenting. </p><p id="efb8c995-6ad6-41c0-8833-c0c5ac40d313" className="">Making artistic decisions is like picking a path to take at a fork in the road. One path might be better, but you can’t know which it is until you pick one and start heading down it. You can always turn around and go down a different path if it doesn’t work out.</p><p id="f2853c1c-6e79-47cd-9288-03e6eb8ef61e" className="">And there is no true end when creating art, no destination. A piece of art is done when the artist decides it so. You could work on a single piece for your entire life. But that wouldn’t be very fun or fulfilling, as I’m sure you have more than a single idea in your head.</p><p id="a2087b1a-8d8d-444c-9014-b439f8c0d384" className="">Art is an iterative process. You will continuously refine and create better and better versions until you’re satisfied with the result. Then you’ll move on to the next piece.</p><p id="d64a312e-08f3-4997-b2ad-f5e0f2a4a8c3" className="">
	</p><h2 id="47436e23-c8c1-439d-a495-147716085295" className="">Recognizability &amp; Simplicity</h2><p id="ae8bac69-481d-45e5-a393-77c24f225faf" className="">So if clarity in our depictions is our biggest goal, how do we achieve that? You might think that in order to help the viewer recognize something, you should give them as many clues as possible, by adding more details. But that’s not really how our brains work. When we look at something, we can understand what it is nearly instantly, and completely unconsciously. There’s no time to process lots of little details, and most of our perception is based on a quick and vague snapshot. It will take a few seconds of looking around the piece and processing each detail separately, and by that time, you’ll have already developed a vague idea, to which the details build upon. </p><h3 id="62fe5efd-9e6f-417a-a20d-d2a4aa98aad5" className="">Silhouettes</h3><p id="4229bb96-f69a-491f-8814-ca7f0133d73b" className="">Silhouettes - or the outer shape of an object - are by far the most important thing to our first impression. </p><p id="8a2d3aa1-f8de-4ccf-8e0a-bfe2f939be9e" className="">Choosing an angle at which your subject is drawn can also have a huge impact on it’s silhouette. Take a look at these silhouettes of a car:</p><figure id="ffb515dd-fc56-473d-93e7-8cdcb3b455cd" className="image"><a href="Untitled.png"><img  src="Untitled.png"/></a></figure><p id="70023e6a-86a0-43fb-aa7b-90900a497b30" className="">They’re all completely accurate, but they are not all equally recognizable. The view from above (bottom left) is the worst - it hardly looks like a car. It could just as easily be a loaf of bread with ears. The front/back views are a little better, they show it’s lifted off the ground, and has some windows, but it’s still not great, it could be a bed or something. The side view is far better. It clearly shows it’s being suspended by the circular wheels, and the outer shape shows the whole hood, roof, and trunk. Yes we lose the mirror detail, but that small detail doesn’t help us recognize cars - if you saw a car without mirrors, it would probably take you a few seconds to notice (if you even do). And by that point, you’ll already be well aware that you’re looking at a car.</p><p id="cf3d2257-28a3-4e87-8c73-ca2b0b1ed6d1" className="">Now that doesn’t mean side view is always best. It depends on the object. Look at a human: </p><figure id="8486ecda-4b40-42f5-9e39-3c0c6d96695d" className="image"><a href="Untitled%201.png"><img  src="Untitled%201.png"/></a></figure><p id="0f572b79-48a5-447c-a936-4867fa707896" className="">Our side view kind of looks like a lumpy snake creature (though it does work well for the head). A front view (or something in between) does a much better job of showing our arms and legs, and where our body starts and ends, which makes it far quicker to recognize.</p><p id="ce4f3e82-0e56-4fc5-a53f-059b2380e60d" className="">So don’t just use silhouettes, choose the best silhouette for your subject.</p><h3 id="82aa2222-21f5-44ff-94d8-7071a1f246bf" className="">Details</h3><p id="d3de1d62-2b7c-4ebc-9c73-3a8dd4798c0a" className="">Now just because silhouettes are most important, doesn’t mean details are useless. They can certainly aid your depiction, provided you put some thought into them. Like I said above, the more details you have, the longer the viewer will have to look around to find and process them. So to use details effectively, you actually want to add as few as possible. Add details that help the viewer understand the subject, and leave the rest out. Check out this example:</p><figure id="31885993-93c2-49d5-ba46-9bf32c1c5a0a" className="image"><a href="Untitled%202.png"><img  src="Untitled%202.png"/></a></figure><p id="142bc1a2-5072-4af8-9e5c-f6fb1c300b0a" className="">While the silhouettes are great, the few face details really make them more recognizable as animals, because we tend to look at faces immediately when we see them. Sure they could have added fur, whiskers, collars, spots, paws, etc, but would that have made you recognize them quicker? Maybe one or two would have helped, but if you try to add them all, it would only slow down the viewers understanding. Leaving out details in pixel art is especially important in pixel art, since we’re working with limited space, and we just can’t include everything.</p><p id="a73d509c-2e22-4a93-a29e-5c5fc43fd6f2" className="">This great quote sums it up nicely:</p><blockquote id="c2db0422-ddc0-41c6-9fa1-bc6ec83ab767" className="">“Perfection is achieved, not when <em>there is nothing more to add</em>, but when <em>there is nothing left to take away”</em>. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery.</blockquote><h2 id="142483b3-4b09-4fb3-9ddd-cd235b54996b" className="">The Tools</h2><p id="15ee57ae-091c-4fec-9253-6257fc5c6c9a" className="">Now you understand the goal and the process, all that’s left is to pick up your tools, and start creating. Most pixel artists use software designed specifically for making pixel art, called pixel editors. It’s also possible to use general drawing/image editing programs such as photoshop (called raster graphics editors), though they will also contain many tools not suited for pixel art. We have a list of recommended software in our #resources channel, as well as on the Lospec website, but you can also ask here for guidance if you need help picking one.</p><p id="89393449-7c5b-4c29-928e-a9240fcd1d97" className="">
	</p><p id="898de888-4b52-41cd-a5da-5db25fd840d7" className="">Pixel art software can contains hundreds of tools, but there is one that stands far above the others, as the most important tool. Every single pixel art image could be created with this one tool, all other tools just make your process easier/faster, as long as you master this one first: the pencil tool.</p><p id="56114a4f-0f08-423f-b77b-1961707ccb66" className="">
	</p><figure className="block-color-gray_background callout"  id="68b36b16-051b-4c99-b770-be784883e864"><div ><span className="icon">📖</span></div><div >Pencil Tool - the most basic tool in pixel art software, which changes any pixel you click on to the desired color</div></figure><p id="c669abc1-fd00-4bb5-81c5-cca2abc85fb7" className="">
	</p><p id="3420e1dd-acc8-440e-8a6b-41fd7e2a9c18" className="">As long as you can locate your pencil tool, you can create pixel art. The most simple pixel art workflow loop looks like this:</p><ol type="1" id="c7d92639-e120-4bcf-95c1-296d038e5dbd" className="numbered-list"><li>select a color</li></ol><ol type="1" id="5a294429-b1bb-4e26-b11a-c77ff4092ec9" className="numbered-list" ><li>place pixels of that color</li></ol><p id="e076dfdb-bb83-48fc-a16a-c61343d9cc02" className="">You can repeat these two step over and over until your piece is complete. As you learn more techniques and tools you’ll add more steps to your process, but for now it’s best to master the basics.</p><p id="7b0b0054-0664-40d0-b833-3212a117a757" className="">What’s great about pixel art is that it’s so forgiving, and infinitely editable. You don’t have to get your lines right on your first try, you can just get the general shapes down, and then tweak and perfect it for as long as you need to until you’re satisfied.</p><h2 id="86020304-ba20-441e-b61a-980ab8eb3260" className="">Summary</h2><p id="2ee5c475-6cb8-4a1e-8a59-5b7cbbb244c9" className="">The most important things to take away from this lesson is that pixel art is a puzzle, and an iterative process. You just have to keep pushing pixels around until you’re happy with it. And your #1 goal, is that someone else can understand what you’re trying to depict.</p><p id="1aa014d3-83b6-42f3-a4d7-dc7d3cc4eec7" className="">So today, you will practice depiction. You will be given a subject, and will have to draw that subject in a way that another person can look at it and know what it is you were trying to depict, without having to be told. </p><h2 id="0299b82d-3e40-4b51-93fe-38451b0f6e0c" className="">Assignments</h2><h3 id="94fd8ee4-1396-4f77-95b8-a9fe5fa719d9" className=""><strong>Assignment 1:</strong></h3><p id="ff05af9e-8b88-4f75-b193-b652e237a96a" className="">Download the assignment sheet below, and open it in your chosen pixel art software.
